Example code to talk to a MPU9250 MEMS accelerometer and gyroscope.
Ignores the magnetometer, that is left as a exercise for the reader.

This is taking to simple approach of simply reading registers. It's perfectly
possible to link up an interrupt line and set things up to read from the
inbuilt FIFO to make it more useful.

NOTE: Ensure the device is capable of being driven at 3.3v NOT 5v. The Pico
GPIO (and therefor SPI) cannot be used at 5v.

You will need to use a level shifter on the I2C lines if you want to run the
board at 5v.

Connections on Raspberry Pi Pico board and a generic MPU9250 board, other
boards may vary.

GPIO 4 (pin 6) MISO/spi0_rx-> ADO on MPU9250 board
GPIO 5 (pin 7) Chip select -> NCS on MPU9250 board
GPIO 6 (pin 9) SCK/spi0_sclk -> SCL on MPU9250 board
GPIO 7 (pin 10) MOSI/spi0_tx -> SDA on MPU9250 board
3.3v (pin 36) -> VCC on MPU9250 board
GND (pin 38)  -> GND on MPU9250 board
