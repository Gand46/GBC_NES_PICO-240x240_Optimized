Example code to talk to a bme280 humidity/temperature/pressure sensor.

NOTE: Ensure the device is capable of being driven at 3.3v NOT 5v. The Pico
GPIO (and therefor SPI) cannot be used at 5v.

You will need to use a level shifter on the SPI lines if you want to run the
board at 5v.

Connections on Raspberry Pi Pico board and a generic bme280 board, other
boards may vary.

GPIO 16 (pin 21) MISO/spi0_rx-> SDO/SDO on bme280 board
GPIO 17 (pin 22) Chip select -> CSB/!CS on bme280 board
GPIO 18 (pin 24) SCK/spi0_sclk -> SCL/SCK on bme280 board
GPIO 19 (pin 25) MOSI/spi0_tx -> SDA/SDI on bme280 board
3.3v (pin 3;6) -> VCC on bme280 board
GND (pin 38)  -> GND on bme280 board
