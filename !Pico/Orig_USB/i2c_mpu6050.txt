Example code to talk to a MPU6050 MEMS accelerometer and gyroscope

This is taking to simple approach of simply reading registers. It's perfectly
possible to link up an interrupt line and set things up to read from the
inbuilt FIFO to make it more useful.

NOTE: Ensure the device is capable of being driven at 3.3v NOT 5v. The Pico
GPIO (and therefor I2C) cannot be used at 5v.

You will need to use a level shifter on the I2C lines if you want to run the
board at 5v.

Connections on Raspberry Pi Pico board, other boards may vary.

GPIO 4 (pin 6)-> SDA on MPU6050 board
GPIO 5 (pin 7)-> SCL on MPU6050 board
3.3v (pin 36) -> VCC on MPU6050 board
GND (pin 38)  -> GND on MPU6050 board
