# Optimization Tasks for Pi Pico GBC Emulator

This document tracks potential optimizations gathered from analysis of open-source Game Boy and Game Boy Color emulators.

## CPU and Instruction Cycle
- [ ] Maintain cycle accuracy only where visible; consider event-based simulation for timers.
- [ ] Replace large opcode `switch` statements with dispatch tables and precomputed values.
- [ ] Apply ARM Cortex-M0+ specific tricks (bit operations, 32-bit transfers).

## Memory and Bus Access
- [ ] Cache frequently used memory regions in fast RAM.
- [x] Use dirty flags to redraw graphics only when display memory changes.
- [ ] Buffer SD card I/O and reuse buffers.

## Video Pipeline
- [ ] Split rendering into stages (tile fetch, sprite composition, etc.).
- [ ] Precompute color palette conversions per tile instead of per pixel.
- [ ] Offload LCD updates to the second core using DMA/PIO.

## Audio
- [ ] Generate audio in larger blocks and mix channels in a circular buffer.
- [ ] Replace expensive math operations with lookup tables where possible.

## RP2040 Hardware Utilization
- [ ] Leverage PIO and DMA for repetitive transfers (LCD, SD).
- [ ] Disable unused peripherals to reduce noise and power draw.

## Debugging and Profiling
- [ ] Add lightweight profiling counters to identify hotspots.
- [ ] Compare cycle counts with reference emulators such as SameBoy or Gambatte.

## Reference Comparisons
- [ ] Study structures from mGBA, Gambatte, SameBoy for additional optimizations.
