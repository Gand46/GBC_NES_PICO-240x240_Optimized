This example DMAs 16kB of data from the start of flash to SRAM, and
measures the transfer speed.

The SSI (flash interface) inside the XIP block has DREQ logic, so we can
DMA directly from its FIFOs. Unlike the XIP stream hardware (see
flash_xip_stream.c) this can *not* be done whilst code is running from
flash, without careful footwork like we do here. The tradeoff is that it's
~2.5x as fast in QSPI mode, ~2x as fast in SPI mode.
